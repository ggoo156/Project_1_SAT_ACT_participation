# Project 1: SAT & ACT Analysis

### Overview

For this project, we're going to take a look at aggregate SAT and ACT scores and participation rates from each state in the United States. We'll look to identify trends in the data and combine our data analysis with outside research to identify likely factors affecting participation rates and scores in United States.

Here's a specific issues that can help you understand with background information.
> The new format for the SAT was released in March 2016. As an employee of the College Board - the organization that administers the SAT - we are a part of a team that tracks statewide participation and recommends where money is best spent to improve SAT participation rates. Our presentation and report are geared toward **non-technical** executives with the College Board and we will use the provided data and outside research to make recommendations about how the College Board might work to increase the participation rate in a **state of our choice**.


### Datasets

#### Provided Data

For this project, we have two provided datasets:

- [2017 SAT Scores](./data/sat_2017.csv)
- [2017 ACT Scores](./data/act_2017.csv)

These data give average SAT and ACT scores by state, as well as participation rates, for the graduating class of 2017.

You can see the source for the SAT data [here](https://blog.collegevine.com/here-are-the-average-sat-scores-by-state/), and the source for the ACT data [here](https://blog.prepscholar.com/act-scores-by-state-averages-highs-and-lows). **Make sure you cross-reference your data with your data sources to eliminate any data collection or data entry issues.**

#### Additional Data

Manually collected data of 2018 state-by-state average results and participation for the SAT are from PDF reports [here](https://reports.collegeboard.org/sat-suite-program-results/state-results). 2018 ACT state-by-state mean composite scores and participation rates are [here](http://www.act.org/content/dam/act/unsecured/documents/cccr2018/Average-Scores-by-State.pdf).
